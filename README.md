Welcome to the OSS Compass Community!

We provide a public SaaS platform [OSS Compass](https://oss-compass.org/) for open source community health analytics, that is open for all the projects hosted on Github, Gitee, etc.

# Our Vision

* Through [OSS Compass](https://oss-compass.org/), we help people who need community data analysis, including but not limited to OSPOs, community managers, academic researchers, project owners, maintainers, developers, etc.
* By analyzing real data from a large number of open source projects, and referring to research results from industry best practices and academics, we create an open source community [Ecosystem Evaluation System](https://github.com/oss-compass/docs/tree/main/metrics-models) that can be continuously improved and evolved, and give back to the general open source communities by means of [OSS Compass](https://oss-compass.org/).

## Quick Start

You can clicking [Quick Start](<https://oss-compass.org/docs/quick-start>) to experience our services.
