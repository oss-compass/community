The Data Hub Service currently has mirror sites at Peking University and the Institute of Software (CAS).

### 2. Open Source Software Selection Evaluation Service

Liang Guanyu, engineer at the Institute of Software (CAS) and OSS-Compass Board member, introduced the open source selection capabilities enhanced by OSS-Compass for the Central Repository. Integrating OSS-Compass evaluation technology, it enables automated maintainability assessment for software packages, supports financial industry open source standard implementation, and plans to build a software institute mirror site, integrate risk maintenance evaluation, and access intelligent recommendation services to become a best practice for open source evaluation.

### 3. Open Source Ecosystem Insight Service

Zhao Hailing, project lead of China Open Source Development In-Depth Report at the OpenAtom Foundation, announced that OSS-Compass serves as the core data platform for global open source ecosystem insights. Analysis based on 100+ million samples shows China ranked third in global open source contribution in 2024, first in AI, with developer retention rates exceeding India—but 14th in import/export, reflecting an "export-led" feature. The foundation plans to build an open source ecosystem research community with OSS-Compass, focusing on annual reports and insight activities.

### 4. Developer Profiling Service & Intelligent Component Recommendation

Wang Liang, Associate Professor at Nanjing University and Co-Chair of the OSS-Compass Technical Committee, shared insights on developer profiling through "skill + willingness" dual-dimension modeling, achieving 83% recall rate with 1.13 million data validations. Emotional features provide important reference value for contribution willingness assessment. Component recommendation progresses in phases: Phase 1 covers 110,000 third-party libraries, Phase 2 multi-layer graph model achieves 66% recommendation accuracy, with future plans to introduce large models for deeper requirement understanding. Both features are now live on OSS-Compass.

## III. Planning Discussion for Two Working Groups

### 1. ISO Working Group Establishment

Daniel Izquierdo introduced the ISO Working Group, which aims to promote international standards for open source community evaluation. The group attracts participation from domestic and international institutions including Peking University, OpenAtom Open Source Foundation, National Industrial Information Security Development Research Center, China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Huawei, ByteDance, Linux Foundation CHAOSS community, and Bitergia. Supported by OSS-Compass data and integrating industry best practices, the group plans to complete a standard draft by 2025 through open initiatives and industrial practice integration, promoting global collaboration to reduce enterprise costs, enhance brand trust, address geopolitical challenges, and drive the open source ecosystem from technical competition toward rule co-construction.

### 2. AI Working Group Business Planning

Led by Qi Guoqiang, head of the OSS-Compass AI Working Group, the initiative addresses the growing enterprise dependence on open source software. The open source market reached $33 billion in 2023 and is projected to exceed $100 billion by 2032, forming a "core triangle" of supply side (open source communities), demand side (enterprise applications), and capability side (academic research and ecosystem tools). OSS-Compass has served academic research and enterprise open source management for two years, building a complete capability system from data processing to model analysis, while facing challenges like missing paper data and high customization costs. As AI evolves from collaboration to production workflows and toward industry search engines, OSS-Compass is advancing a "1+1+N+N" intelligence strategy through key capabilities in interaction, intent, execution, and knowledge engineering, transforming data and rules into knowledge to create an intelligent open source ecosystem platform.
