# **01 Contributor Name Search Function Launched**

Open the project report page and click to enter the Project Deep Dive Insight Solution page of the project. In the contributor persona details table, you can now see a search box added at the header of the contributor column.

Just click this search button, enter the name of the contributor in the pop-up input box, and their information will immediately be displayed before your eyes.

From now on, there's no need to scroll through the screen, flipping through pages to find contributor information.

# **02 Contributor Avatar Display**

Not only that, but we've also updated a friendly little detailâ€”

In the contributor persona details table, you can now see the GitHub or Gitee repository avatar of each contributor!

This not only makes information retrieval more intuitive but also makes social interactions in open source projects more humanized.

# **03 One-Click Jump to Contributor's Repository Homepage**

If you want to delve deeper into a contributor's open source contributions, you can simply click on their name to jump directly to their code hosting repository homepage.

Whether you want to further communicate and cooperate or just want to learn more about their work, this feature makes it easy to achieve.

# **04 This Is More Than Just a Feature Update**

This update is not just about adding features; it's also an experience optimization for the open source community users.

We believe that through such thoughtful feature updates, we can help project managers and contributors collaborate more efficiently, making the ecosystem of the open source community more vibrant and healthy.
