models have been added, including "Contributor Domain Persona",
"Contributor Milestone Persona" and "Contributor Role Persona".

evaluation metrics, and all metrics of the "Collaborative Development
Index", "Community Service and Support", "Community Activity" and
"Organization Activity" models were atomized, totaling 45 metrics,
including five types of code, issues, PRs, repositories, and
contributors.
