Hi, dear OSS Compass users! It's time for another edition of "OSS Compass New Feature Reveals"! Today, we are going to introduce a brand-new feature, one that has been eagerly requested by users, making OSS Compass project report pages more powerful and flexible! Without further ado, let's take a look~

### 01 Project Report Page Review

Do you remember not too long ago when we introduced the OSS Compass (hereinafter referred to as "Compass") project report page, the magical page that allows you to understand project development trends at a glance? Yes, that's right, it's the page below!

You just need to search for your project on the Compass official website, then click on it to enter the project report page, where all project data is presented in intuitive chart form. Thus, you can easily understand the development of your project in various aspects. You can also download these charts with a single click for your project report analysis.

### 02 User's Creative Idea

However, over two months ago, we received a request from a user. This user wanted more than just static charts: he wanted to embed specific metric charts into his own website and receive real-time data updates. In other words, he wanted a "live" chart, not a "dead" one.

You might be wondering: what does a "live" chart mean? Simply put, when you embed this chart on your website, it can update in real-time and provide you with the latest data. Unlike the previous download function, where the chart remains static and doesn't change (as shown above).

This user is a big fan of the Compass community, always pushing us to pursue excellence!

### 03 Engineer Action

Our engineering team heard this request and immediately sprang into action. In a technical meeting within the community, they decided to implement this feature as quickly as possible to fulfill the user's wish.

But implementing this feature is not easy because Compass analyzes over 50,000 projects, each with dozens of evaluation metrics, which requires creating a large number of URL links and ensuring that the SVG format images in these links can update in real-time.

It may sound a bit daunting, but our engineering team is incredibly powerful! We've been working hard to bring you a better experience!

### 04 New Feature Online

Now, here's the good news! We've finally implemented this feature, allowing you to freely select a specific metric chart, embed it as a link on your website, and get the latest data at any time.

It's like installing a real-time monitor for your project, keeping an eye on your project's health. Want to know the project's activity, number of contributors, submission frequency, and more? No problem, just select the relevant chart, paste it into your web page, and you can easily stay informed.

This is an exciting moment, isn't it? Now, whether you're a developer, project manager, or a user interested in open-source projects, you can use Compass data more flexibly, and it's very easy to use.
