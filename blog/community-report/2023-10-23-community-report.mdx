### Part 2: Technical Progress

Since our official release on February 21, 2023, OSS Compass has been continuously accelerating its iterations and optimizations at the technical level to provide superior metric models and SaaS services, as well as expanding its data sets.

#### Data Sets

From July to September, Compass evaluation datasets have been expanded with over 30,000 projects added, and the total number of open source projects in our database has been increased from over 20,000 to 50,000, offering users a wider selection. We also optimized the technical categorization of projects, adding over 200 sub-categories, increasing the total number of categories from 100+ to 300+.

| Category                        | The numbers at the beginning of July | The numbers at the end of September | Increased by |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Numbers of open source projects | 20000+                               | 50000+                              | 30000+       |
| Technical catagories            | 100+                                 | 300+                                | 200+         |

#### Open Source Ecosystem Evaluation System

We optimized the existing 30+ evaluation metrics and 4 evaluation models, enhancing the "last updated" metric in the activity model and excluding archived repositories from evaluation metrics. We broke down all the metrics for the "Collaborative Development Index", "Community Service and Support", "Activity" and "Organization Activity" models, including five types: code, issues, pull requests, repositories, and contributors, totaling 45 individual metrics.

#### SaaS Services

From July to September, Compass introduced a new SaaS service called Compass Lab, along with some project dashboard features such as Compass badges, Y-axis Scaling for charts, switching between One-Point System and Percentage System, and one-click access to repositories.

We optimized the previous hot field on homepage by dividing it into two sections: popular projects and popular categories. The popular projects section showcases recent, highly popular projects related to open source LLM and deep learning frameworks, while the popular categories randomly display projects from different technical categories.
