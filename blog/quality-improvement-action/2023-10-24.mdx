Shenzhen, October 24, 2023 - This morning, the National Industrial Information Security Development Research Center, in collaboration with Nanjing University, Huawei, Open Source China, Baidu, and other entities, grandly launched the "Open Source Community Development Quality Improvement Action" at the "2023 Shenzhenâ€¢China 1024 Programmer Festival". The aim is to promote the healthy development of open source communities. This action will rely on the research results of the OSS Compass community to release the first comprehensive open source community development evaluation index in China. Simultaneously, it will construct an evaluation system for the ecological development of open source communities in different technical fields.

At the event, Ping Zhou, Chief Engineer of the National Industrial Information Security Development Research Center, Meng Ke, Director of Huawei Open Source Management Center, and two Board members of the OSS Compass community - Associate Professor Liang Wang from Nanjing University and Hongshu, CTO of Open Source China, along with other guests, gathered together to attend the launch ceremony and witnessed the formal beginning of this significant action.

In recent years, the digital economy has become a new engine and new momentum for the global economy, and open source plays a crucial role in the rapid upgrade and integration of digital technology. Open source collaboration continues to lead the innovative development of digital technology standards, constantly driving the transformation of traditional industry patterns and business models, gradually becoming a key support for the rapid development of the digital economy and digital transformation. By promoting the construction of an open source innovation ecosystem, we will be able to accelerate the transformation and application of digital technology, providing a stronger internal driving force for economic development and bringing new opportunities for the digital transformation and pattern change of the economic and social sectors.

Given the increasing importance of open source applications and participation today, evaluating the open source ecosystem and promoting the health and sustainable development of open source communities and projects have become common concerns for governments, enterprises, and individual developers. The establishment of OSS Compass is precisely to provide valuable data insights and trend analysis for government departments, open source communities, enterprises, and developers, thereby supporting the health and sustainable development of China's open source ecosystem. Now, the official launch of the "Open Source Community Development Quality Improvement Action" will further promote the development of open source communities, stimulate innovation in digital technology, and provide more support and momentum for the digital transformation of our country's economy.
