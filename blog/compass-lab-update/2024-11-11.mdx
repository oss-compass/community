#### **1. Enter the home page: revamped and clearer**

When you enter the home page of Compass Lab, you can see that our model list has been revamped, and you can directly click on the model to enter the model details page; in addition, we have added new indicators to filter the conditions of classification, such as “frequency of submission of organizational code, and continuous contribution of the organization”. This will help you find your model more quickly and accurately.

#### **3. Generate evaluation report: more accurate customization**

After the model is created, users can use the specified version of the model in “My Models” to evaluate, i.e., select the dataset and generate a model report. Different model versions can generate different model evaluation reports, so users can customize the reports according to their own preferences.

In addition, we have added a new sharing button for public models, so that other users can access the model through the link and view the public model report, or use the public model version to evaluate the model directly, isn't it convenient and practical?
