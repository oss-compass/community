## I. Release of In-depth Report on China's Open Source Development (2024)

On July 23, the OpenAtom Foundation officially released In-depth Report on China's Open Source Development (2024) (click to view detailed introduction) (hereinafter referred to as the "Report"). The Report was led by the OpenAtom Foundation and jointly compiled with the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, the National Industrial Information Security Development Research Center, the China Electronics Information Industry Development Research Institute, the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the School of Software, Tsinghua University, the School of Computer Science, Peking University, the Institute of Open Source Innovation and Digital Governance, Shanghai University of International Business and Economics, Yunqi Capital, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Qi An Xin Technology Group Co., Ltd., the Investment Professional Committee of the China Software Industry Association, and the OSS-Compass community.

During the release session, Cheng Xiaoming, Chairman and Secretary-General of the OpenAtom Foundation; Ke Meng, representative of the OSS-Compass community; Zhang Ge, Chief Engineer of the National Industrial Information Security Development Research Center; and Wang Jianmin, Dean of the School of Software, Tsinghua University, respectively interpreted various aspects such as the overall development trend of China's open source in 2024 and data on domestic and foreign open source projects and developers over the past three years.

### 01 Cheng Xiaoming, Chairman and Secretary-General of the OpenAtom Foundation

Cheng Xiaoming stated that the Report focuses on the overall development trend of open source in 2024, sorts out data on global open source projects and developers over the past three years, conducts analysis on licenses, code platforms, technical fields, security, and commercialization, puts forward targeted suggestions, and comprehensively demonstrates the positive results of China's open source system construction.

### 02 Ke Meng, Representative of the OSS-Compass Community

Ke Meng noted that China's national open source contributions exceeded 700 million for the first time in 2024, with China, the United States, and India contributing nearly 200 million. China ranked first in the world with approximately 2.3 million active developers, and the open source collaboration network is accelerating its shift eastward. In China, both Beijing and Shanghai have over 500,000 active open source projects and over 400,000 active open source developers, with project sustainability on par with that in Europe and the United States.

### 03 Zhang Ge, Chief Engineer of the National Industrial Information Security Development Research Center

Zhang Ge pointed out that China has formed five local open source ecosystem models: resource-agglomeration type (represented by Beijing and Wuhan), innovation-driven type (represented by Shanghai and Hangzhou), industry-empowering type (represented by Chongqing), application-oriented type (represented by Shenzhen), and multi-city cluster type (represented by Jiangsu). The Report suggests layout based on local conditions, strengthening policy implementation and compliance training, and promoting the connection and collaborative development of open source supply and demand.

### 04 Wang Jianmin, Dean of the School of Software, Tsinghua University

Wang Jianmin stated that open source education requires collaboration among the government, enterprises, universities, and communities. It is necessary to deepen policy guidance, curriculum reform, and integration of industry and education. He suggested promoting open source culture, co-building a talent ecosystem, improving universities' open source capabilities through teacher development and practical teaching, and promoting in-depth integration of education and industrial innovation.

## II. "Insights into the Development Trend of China's Open Source" Sub-forum

On July 24, the "Insights into the Development Trend of China's Open Source" sub-forum was held in Conference Room 265, Phase II of the Beijing National Convention Center. The forum in-depth interpreted the current situation and cutting-edge trends of open source projects and developers, shared operational experiences and commercialization paths of typical open source projects, and discussed the latest progress and typical cases of open source compliance governance. Meanwhile, the forum officially launched the compilation of In-depth Report on China's Open Source Development (2025), aiming to jointly draw a panoramic blueprint for China's open source development. At the forum, representatives from the OSS-Compass Board, Professor Zhou Minghui and Wang Yehui, shared insights related to "open source projects and developers' development trends".

### 01 Zhou Minghui, Vice Dean and Professor of the School of Computer Science, Peking University; OSS-Compass Board Member

Zhou Minghui stated that the In-depth Report on China's Open Source Development (2024) was created by the OpenAtom Foundation in collaboration with nearly twenty universities, enterprises, and other institutions, presenting a panoramic view of global and Chinese open source development trends: In 2024, global open source contributions reached 700 million, with China's 46.7 million contributions rebounding (up 24.05% year-on-year), with cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen leading the growth; globally, there are over 15 million active developers, with China leading at 2.2729 million, and new developer retention rates of 70%-80% being outstanding; in technical fields, China's AI contributions of 3.19 million topped the world, and the chip sector averaged over 121% growth over two years. The report further reveals China's true potential in open source collaboration and project activity, providing key references for ecosystem construction. The OSS-Compass community is building an open source data hub, promoting industry-academia-research integration, and jointly building a globalized open source innovation ecosystem to unlock opportunities in the new era of open source!

### 02 Wang Yehui, Co-Chairman of the OSS-Compass Technical Committee

Wang Yehui shared the OSS-Compass community's 2025 planning and progress around "open source project technical field classification" and "developer profiling and recommendation". He stated that OSS-Compass has addressed issues such as coarse-grained traditional technical field classification and blurred boundaries by constructing an LLM-empowered hierarchical technical field insight model that can accurately classify project domains, such as clearly positioning vLLM as an AI large model inference framework and identifying cross-domain projects like ReAct. At the same time, a developer profiling and recommendation solution was launched, which constructs contributor collaboration networks and characterizes developers from multiple dimensions such as skills, activity, and influence, helping to discover potential contributors and core talents. Whether for refined ecosystem governance or community talent operations, there is now strong support. Finally, he proposed that in the future, he hopes more people will join the OSS-Compass community to explore the new journey of open source together!

## III. OSS-Compass Booth at the Conference

In the conference exhibition area, the OSS-Compass community booth was very lively, not only setting up interactive experience sessions, providing detailed introductions and inviting attendees to experience the community's five core functions on-site, but also having dedicated personnel to answer questions in real-time, helping everyone gain an in-depth understanding of the community's value. In addition, the OSS-Compass community prepared a series of exquisite gifts for participants, attracting nearly 200 people to actively participate.

In the future, the OSS-Compass community will continue to work hard, continuously optimize the community's functional experience, inject more vitality into the healthy development of the open source ecosystem, and look forward to joining hands with more developers, enterprises, and institutions to explore the path of open source innovation together!
