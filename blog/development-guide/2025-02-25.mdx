**OSS-Compass Community Development Guide:**

This development guide is jointly compiled by the members of the OSS-Compass community team. Its core objective is to help developers efficiently deploy GrimoireLab, set up front-end and back-end development environments, and expand the Compass indicator model. It covers the complete process from infrastructure setup to indicator development.

**Website:** https://github.com/oss-compass/docs/tree/main/developer-guide

**Overall Features:**

- Full coverage of the technology stack: Covers mainstream technologies such as Ruby, Node.js, Python, Docker, and OpenSearch, meeting the needs of full-stack development.
- Out-of-the-box: Provides Docker Compose templates and environment variable templates to reduce the cost of manual configuration.
- Community-driven: Deeply integrates GitHub/Gitee data sources and supports multi-dimensional analysis of the health of open-source communities.
- Modular design: Decouples services, data, and indicators in layers, supporting flexible expansion and customized development.

**Applicable Scenarios:**

- Platform deployment: Quickly build the service and data infrastructure of the OSS-Compass platform.
- Indicator development: Expand the analysis capabilities of the OSS-Compass platform and develop customized indicators and models.
- Full-stack development: Supports the full-stack development needs from the back-end to the front-end, and from data crawling to indicator calculation.

The OSS-Compass development guide consists of four parts: **"Data Infrastructure Deployment Guide"**, **"Front-end and Back-end Deployment Guide"**, **"Data Indexing and Storage Specification"**, and **"Practical Guide to Indicator Development"**. The specific content is as follows:

**1.Data Infrastructure Deployment Guide**

Introduction: As the foundation of Compass's data analysis capabilities, this guide ensures the efficient operation of the GrimoireLab ecosystem, supports the crawling of raw data as a basis for indicator calculation and development, and supports the multi-platform compatibility of open-source community data.

File: Grimoirelab Deployment Guide.md

Features:

- Standardization of core components: Details the deployment of the OpenSearch cluster and MariaDB database, and provides Docker Compose templates and manual configuration references.
- Integration of customized components: Guides the installation of Compass-customized GrimoireLab components (such as grimoirelab-elk-gitee) to adapt to the data crawling and enhancement of GitHub/Gitee data sources.
- Pre-configuration of the environment: Includes installation scripts for basic environments such as Python 3.8 and Docker, reducing the risk of dependency conflicts.

**2.Front-end and Back-end Deployment Guide**

Introduction: This guide provides a standardized process for the deployment of the front-end and back-end services of the Compass platform, covering the configuration details of the development and production environments from the installation of basic dependencies to the startup of the services.

File: Compass Backend & Frontend Service Deployment.md

Features:

- Modular deployment: Covers the independent deployment processes of the back-end (Ruby on Rails), front-end (Next.js), gateway (Nginx), and scheduled task services, supporting flexible expansion.
- Detailed environment configuration: Provides a complete .env file template, covering configuration examples of key components such as the database (MariaDB), message queue (RabbitMQ), cache (Redis), and email service (SMTP).
- Containerization support: Achieves rapid deployment through Docker and Docker Compose, including multi-service orchestration (such as the separate deployment of the front-end document service and the main site service).

**3.Data Indexing and Storage Specification**

Introduction: This specification provides a standardized design for OpenSearch data storage, ensuring data consistency and scalability, and is the core data support for the Compass indicator model.

File: OpenSearch Index.md

Features:

- Clear index classification: Defines 7 types of core indexes (such as repositories, commit records, PRs, contributors, etc.), clarifying the data structure and purpose of each index.
- Enhanced design: Distinguishes between raw data (such as github-issues) and enhanced data (such as github-issues_enriched), supporting complex analysis scenarios.
- Final indicator aggregation: Stores the calculated indicator results centrally through the compass_metric_model_custom_v1 index, facilitating visualization and API calls.

**4.Practical Guide to Indicator Development**

Introduction: A practical manual for developers, combined with code examples and configuration templates, guiding how to develop customized indicators in the Compass ecosystem, emphasizing the reusability and the efficiency of local debugging.

File: 开发指标步骤\_zh.md

Features:

- End-to-end process: From data crawling (GrimoireLab debugging), indicator development (Python function expansion) to Lab integration, covering the complete development cycle.
- Debugging-friendly: Provides VSCode remote debugging configuration examples, supports the phased execution of raw and enrich, and reduces the development threshold.
- Modular expansion: Achieves the rapid registration of new indicators and the configuration of thresholds by modifying thresholds.yaml and base_metrics_model.py.

Okay, the above is the detailed introduction of the OSS-Compass development guide. We hope that this development guide can help all developers better understand, use, or participate in the development work of the OSS-Compass platform. At the same time, we also welcome more open-source enthusiasts to join the OSS-Compass community and contribute to the open-source cause together!
