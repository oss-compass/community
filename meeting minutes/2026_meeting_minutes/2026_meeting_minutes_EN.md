# 2026-01-06 Weekly Meeting Minutes of OSS Compass Community
## Time
January 6 2026, 19:00-20:00 PM Beijing time
## Attendees
Wang Yehui, Qi Guoqiang， Zhu Jiashun, Dai Ruiqi, Wang Lei, Ran Fengyuan, Li Shengbao, Lai Xingyou, Li Songnan, Li Chunmin
### I. Progress Report on the Libyear Project & Open Source Summer Internship (Zhu Jiashun, Dai Ruiqi, Ran Fengyuan)
Discussions were held on issues related to software package upstream addresses, source code address resolution, and community ecosystem health assessment. Relevant personnel suggested leveraging expert experience for judgment to enhance credibility; introducing an automatic blacklist mechanism to skip entities with repeated failures, thereby improving crawler stability; and refining reasoning scripts while integrating large model APIs to boost judgment accuracy. It was agreed that an initial demo version would be released by late January or early February, with all participants expected to advance work in accordance with the schedule.

Updates were provided on the current multi-round dialogue and context management mechanism, Agent system design, report generation and template design, among other aspects. Qi Guoqiang proposed that statistics should be collected on the frequency of use and success rate of the Agent to facilitate performance optimization.

Deliberations covered API restructuring and data calculation, definition of community health dimensions, application of models and Agents, and design of data analysis pipelines. Wang Yehui introduced the main services and product roadmap of OSS Compass, emphasizing the need for consistency in model definitions and calculation methods to align with the OSS Compass evaluation system. He suggested using Agents to expand the scope and scenarios of model application, thereby continuously optimizing and verifying model effectiveness.
### II. Progress on the Technology Classification Project (Li Shengbao)
A progress update on technology classification was delivered. To date, over 5 million projects have been analyzed, with further analysis underway. Qi Guoqiang pointed out that intermediate results should be reviewed on a regular basis and planned to explore deeper insights through multi-round interactions. Regarding the paid nature of the Google Search API, he stated that a decision on its adoption would be made after cost evaluation.
### III. Discussion on Community Gifts (Li Chunmin)
Discussions centered on the selection of relevant gifts and the scale of distribution. Follow-up work will be continued, with feedback provided in a timely manner.
### IV. Outstanding Issues
Collect statistics on the frequency of use and success rate of the Agent.(Responsible Person: Zhu Jiashun；Completion Date: January 13, 2026)

# 2026-01-20 Weekly Meeting Minutes of OSS Compass Community
## Time
January 20 2026, 19:00-20:00 PM Beijing time
## Attendees
Qi Guoqiang, Zhang Shengxiang, Zhu Jiashun, Dai Ruiqi, Wang Lei, Ran Fengyuan, Li Shengbao, Lai Xingyou, Li Songnan, Li Chunmin
### I. Progress Report on Libyear Project & Open Source Summer Internship (Zhu Jiashun, Dai Ruiqi, Ran Fengyuan)
The team discussed the environment construction of Agent and Chain of Thought (COT), as well as the chatDEV project. Ran Fengyuan pointed out that the chatDEV project is associated with programming and corresponding program design. Qi Guoqiang mentioned the application of containers and Kubernetes (K8s) in environment construction, and suggested referring to relevant projects.

Zhu Jiashun and Dai Ruiqi respectively reported the progress of the projects under their charge and put forward the problems encountered. The team deliberated on anti-crawling strategies and corresponding solutions for web crawlers. Qi Guoqiang advised optimizing the crawler strategy, paying close attention to account suspension logic, and avoiding anti-crawling peak periods as much as possible.
### II.  Progress of Technical Classification Project (Wang Lei)
Wang Lei presented the findings of paper research on developer evaluation, and the group discussed the community matching algorithm, code quality assessment and modeling. Qi Guoqiang proposed the need to introduce code importance modeling into programming capability and technical influence evaluation.
### III. Discussion on Community Operations (Zhang Shengxiang)
The discussion focused on the development trends of AI and Agent, as well as the traffic-driven nature of the Agent network. Zhang Shengxiang introduced the mechanism of remote Agent invocation, and noted that recent research has been divided into two directions: model enhancement capability and Agent orchestration. At present, most research remains at the framework and theoretical level, and specific applications are not yet mature. Qi Guoqiang expressed the hope for continuous communication and knowledge sharing in subsequent work.
### IV. Outstanding Issues
None.
