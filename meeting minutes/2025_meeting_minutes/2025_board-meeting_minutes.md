## Agenda
### I. Election of New Board Members
At the beginning of the meeting, the election process of new members of the Community Board was officially launched. Liang Guanyu from the Institute of Software of the Chinese Academy of Sciences elaborated in detail on the scientific research strength and innovative achievements of the Institute of Software of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and expounded in depth on the cooperation project plan with the Compass Community. His application proposal was unanimously recognized by all the members present and passed with a unanimous vote. Thus, Liang Guanyu officially represented the Institute of Software of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and joined the big family of the Compass Community.

### II. Review of the Community's Work in 2024
Wang Yehui and Wang Liang, members of the Compass Community Board of Directors and Co-chairmen of the Technical Committee, reported the main progress of the Compass Community in 2024 to the members of the Board of Trustees:
#### 1.Assisting in Preparing the "In-depth Report on the Development of Open Source in China (2024)"
In 2024, the Compass Community assisted the OpenAtom Foundation in meticulously preparing the "In-depth Report on the Development of Open Source in China (2024)". Currently, this report is expected to be officially released in May. In addition, the Compass Community also collaborated with the teams of Professor Tao Xianping and Professor Wang Liang from Nanjing University to conduct in-depth research on the global open-source ecosystem. By analyzing the development trend of global open-source contribution volume, the pattern of global open-source import and export contributions, the dynamics of active projects and developers, the focus distribution of technical fields, and comparing the differences in the Chinese open-source ecosystem based on the dual-source data of GitHub and OSS-Compass.

#### 2.Intelligent Recommendation of Open-source Software Selection and Mining and Recommendation of High-potential Developers
Professor Wang Liang from Nanjing University carried out professional sharing around the two core themes of "Contributor Profiling and Recommendation Technology" and "Third-party Library Profiling and Recommendation Technology". Aiming at the actual needs of open-source ecosystem construction, taking key projects such as third-party libraries in the HarmonyOS ecosystem as the research objects, an intelligent contributor recommendation system was constructed. This system deeply profiles the technical capabilities and contribution willingness of developers and combines machine learning models to achieve accurate identification of high-potential developers. Based on a large amount of developer data, the system comprehensively depicts multi-dimensional features such as developers' technical activity and cross-project emotional distribution. At the same time, in the research and development of third-party library recommendation technology, it innovatively uses a multi-layer graph model to deeply integrate semantic features such as functional similarity and replacement relationships, significantly improving the recommendation accuracy. In the future, this function will be synchronized to the Compass platform, helping the platform play a greater role in the construction of the open-source ecosystem.

### III. Community Planning for 2025
#### 1.Upgrading of the SaaS Service Matrix
Five core services were grandly launched at the SaaS service layer, covering fields such as open-source situation insight service, community ecosystem evaluation service, developer profiling service, and developer selection evaluation service.

#### 2.Construction of the Mirror Site Ecosystem
Promote the construction of the OSS-Compass mirror site service, and plan to launch platform mirror sites on academic fronts such as domestic universities and research institutions. By creating a stable and efficient data sharing platform, promote OSS-Compass to become a data engine for academic research, policy analysis, and formulation, and further enhance the community's influence in the academic and industrial circles. At the same time, strengthen the construction of AI node capabilities to provide a solid technical guarantee for the implementation of intelligent service solutions.

#### 3.Deepening Win-win Cooperation with Multiple Parties
Continuously deepen the cooperative relationships with organizations and universities such as the Software Institute of the National Center for Industrial Information Security Development Research, the OpenAtom Foundation, the Institute of Software of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, Nanjing University, and OSCHINA. Through cooperation models such as resource sharing, technical collaboration, and joint innovation, jointly tackle key technical problems in the field of open source and promote the healthy and sustainable development of the open-source ecosystem.

### IV. Proposal for ISO International Standard Cooperation
Wang Yehui stated that in 2025, the Compass Community will focus on the research and application of international standards, and jointly promote the formulation of standards for the sustainable development and maintenance of the community by uniting more than 20 enterprises from China, Europe, and the United States. At the same time, a "Try me" link will be added to all the definition pages of indicators and models on the Compass platform to provide users with a more convenient entry for standard practice.

### V. Planning and Discussion on the Construction of the AI Working Group
With the vigorous development of artificial intelligence technology, 2025 is also regarded as a crucial year for the development of large models. The Compass Community keenly captured the industry trend. Qi Guoqiang, a Maintainer of the Compass Community and a senior engineer from Huawei, took the lead in initiating and establishing the AI Working Group to deeply explore the integrated application of AI technology and open-source business. By building a platform for technical exchange and innovation, it gathers the wisdom of experts and developers in the AI field both inside and outside the community, injecting strong impetus into open-source innovation.

### VI. Planning for the Community Annual Meeting in June 2025
In addition, in June 2025, the Compass Community will hold its annual summit at Peking University. At that time, the community will conduct in-depth discussions around the newly launched five SaaS services, and invite authoritative experts, representatives of enterprises and universities, and developers in the industry to gather together.

### VII. Remaining Issues
None.
