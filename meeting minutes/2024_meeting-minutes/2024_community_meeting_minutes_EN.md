## Topic - Progress Discussion on Compass Frontend and Backend and Operational Matters
### Frontend and Backend
1. In the Project Deep Dive Insight Solution page, optimization was made for the filtering of contributor persona and distribution details, requiring further text adjustments.
   - **AP: Xingyou Lai continues optimizing the text.**
2. OSS Compass now supports clicking URLs to redirect to repositories or official websites for open source projects submitted as communities.
3. The "Is Maintained" metrics model chart has been changed to a line graph.
4. The Project Deep Dive Insight Solution needs to support contributor organization information modifying, and the frontend and backend work can be started:
   - Open source project administrators are allowed to modify contributor organization information in the Project Deep Dive Insight Solution page, and contributors are allowed to modify organization information in their personal account setting pages.
   - The above modifications should be done through submitting pull requests (PRs).
   - In case of conflicting information, the information submitted by the contributors take precedence.
   - Changes to organization information take effect immediately and the model data is updated periodically.
   - The dates in the organization information need to be precise (day, month, year).
   - If a contributor has multiple roles or belongs to multiple organizations, they can only select one role at a time, either as an individual contributor or belonging to a specific organization.
   - Create a separate file in the repository for each project to record contributor organization information.
   - Organization information should allow both modifications and additions, with options for manual input and direct selection, along with a predefined list of organization names for selecting during modification.
   - Currently, contributor information is not publicly available.
   - **AP: Shengbao Li and Huatian Qin update the backend, Xingyou Lai modifies the frontend, and Feng Zhong designs the display form of user operations entry.**

   - If there are conflicts between the parsed data and existing Compass data, user-submitted modifications take precedence.
   - **AP: Shengbao Li clearly indicates the priority of data extraction in the relevant documentation.**
7. Data API acquisition mechanism for Compass:
   - Currently, basic data can be obtained directly by parsing the webpage through the API with a set limit on the number of requests.

   - **AP: Huatian Qin and Shengbao Li configure the backend settings.**
### Operations
1. Bilibili account has been created, and WeChat Official Account verification is completed.
