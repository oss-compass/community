4. The projects' secondary categorizations shown in the weekly lists on the home page may have more than one, and the displaying should be alphabetical. **AP: Feng updates the design.**
5. Community updates displaying
   - Currently design is displaying in three blocks.
   - The three blocks are shown at the bottom of the home page, placed in front of the Compass evaluating ecosystem map.
   - The two blocks on the left side need to be designed with flexibility, and the two part may need to be combined as only one block according to the event promotion need.
   - The third block on the right side is the calendar with schedules. Subscription services to allow community members to add the schedule to their own calendar should be provided, and it is recommended that a unified design style is used both in the Chinese and English websites. **AP: Xingyou proceeds with the front-end development, and Feng adjusts the design.**

### Lab front-end
Front-end work is in progress. Only after the metrics splitting work is done, the modification of charts on the dashboard pages can be started. Other work can be finished this week.

### Lab backend
1. The first version of the backend APIs is basically OK. The comment section of the dashboard page is displayed in the form of pictures and plain text separately, and the number of pictures is limited to 5. **AP: Feng needs to consider the design for multiple pictures displaying.**
2. Content compliance: **AP: Huatian should carry out relevant operations according to domestic and international requirements.**
3. Metrics splitting is in progress. Lab/Hub need adding other metrics. **AP: Huatian configures the collector in advance to collect the underlying data to be used for the new metrics.**
4. Software project classification adjustment: setting two levels of classification; operating system classification has been done; support software classification is in progress; application software and other software need to be subdivided; classification granularity should be as small as possible. **AP: Mr. Long puts the classification map into the project information, and keeps updating.***

## Participant
Yehui Wang, Shengxiang Zhang, Chaoqun Huang, Xingyou Lai, Huatian Qin, Shengbao Li, Feng Zhong, Wenxuan Long, Guoqiang Qi, Wenhao Yang, Ruiqiao Qiu, Ran Zhou

## Topics
Compass Lab Frontend and Backend Design Discussion and Planning

### Backend
- (1) High-Level Design: Separate storage of user-customized model analysis report data from existing report content.
- (2) Numbers of datasets and metrics selected by users should be controlled, and selection by project is recommended with some categorization set.
- (3) Users are not allowed to submit data that has not been processed by our model; they must create a new project.
- (4) Versioning Design: Default timestamp or user selection; versions are mapped to models.
- (5) The comment section defaults to the current version, with an option to switch to all versions.
- (6) The official website will be hosted in China and should undergo sensitive word scanning in comments - **Action Point: Yehui Wang and Shengxiang Zhang will continue to discuss how to resolve this.**
- (7) User-defined metrics require disassembling all the metrics from the metric model, creating a new metric set, and adding the disassembled metrics one by one. Mapping is needed for the disassembled metrics and indexes. - **Action Point: Shengbao Li and Huatian Qin will further discuss and refine this process, clarifying the required time and how to interact with OpenSearch. All discussions about this matter should be taken place in the WeChat PKU communication group.**
- (8) Only after the duration of the metric disassembly process is determined, can we know if the business logic can be arranged synchronously with metric disassembly or not.
- (9) Backend development work should be started from today.

### Frontend
- (1) The blog section has been incorporated into the community section on the homepage of OSS Compass website.
- (2) How to display community updates - **Action Point: Ran Zhou will plan community operation content, and we will discuss how to present it in the next meeting.**
- (3) Community users want to embed a specific chart into their web page. **Conclusion: After running each report, generate a static URL for the report's chart to embed it as an image. Provide the charts generated within six months.**

### Conflicts in Compass Subcategory Names
When there is a conflict between submitted and existing categories, modify the existing category name through a pull request, continuously absorbing and merging the subcategory names to reduce technical debt.
